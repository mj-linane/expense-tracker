# About This App

This app is a simple prototype that allows a user to add expenses to a list. The user can then view the list of expenses and filter the list dynamically by year.

The app also includes a simple budgeting bar graph that will show the spending per month of a given year.

## Adaptive Bar Graph

The bar graph is adaptive to show the spending per month mapped to the max spending of that month. Meaning, that the month with the highest spending will appear to fill the bar fully and every other value will be mapped to a percentage of that total.
